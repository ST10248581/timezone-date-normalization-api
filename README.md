# Timezone Date Normalization API

A simple ASP.NET Core Web API that fixes issues with dates being saved incorrectly due to silent UTC conversion. It normalizes incoming `DateTime`, `DateOnly`, and nullable dates using the user's time zone, sent in an `X-Timezone` header.

---

## üêõ Problem: Naive Time Treated as UT
- Angular often sends datetime values as "naive" (no timezone info), which .NET may interpret as UTC by default. This causes stored times to be incorrect, and when they come back to the browser, they appear shifted ‚Äî often 2 hours earlier or later than expected.

    title Bug: Naive Time Interpreted as UTC (Causes Time to Look Earlier)

    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant API
    participant Database

    User->>Browser: Picks 10:00 (local time)
    Browser->>API: Sends 10:00 (naive, no timezone info)
    Note right of API: ‚ùó Assumes 10:00 is UTC instead of local
    API->>Database: Saves 10:00 UTC (actually meant to be 10:00 local)
    Database-->>API: Returns 10:00 UTC
    API-->>Browser: Sends 10:00 UTC
    Note right of Browser: ‚ùó Browser converts 10:00 UTC ‚Üí 12:00 local<br>‚úÖ Looks "later" than user intended

    %% Reverse flow (rebinding a form)
    Note over Browser,API: ‚û∞ Now imagine this gets bound again in a form...
    Browser->>API: Sends 12:00 (naive again)
    API->>Database: Saves as 12:00 UTC
    Note right of Database: ‚ùó This cycle shifts time forward each loop

    %% OR: Bug from interpreting UTC as local on display
    Note right of Browser: üö® In some cases (e.g. Date Picker), browser reads 10:00 UTC<br>as if it were local ‚Üí converts it to UTC again = **08:00 displayed!**
```

## ‚úÖ Solution: Normalize Input Using Timezone Header
- We use a custom .NET ActionFilter to detect the user‚Äôs timezone via a request header (X-Timezone). It then correctly converts naive times to UTC before saving them. When returning UTC values to the UI, JavaScript can explicitly convert them back to local time using the same timezone.

    title Fix: Normalize to Correct UTC Using Timezone Header

    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant API
    participant Filter
    participant Database

    User->>Browser: Selects 10:00 (local time)
    Browser->>API: Sends 10:00 (naive) + X-Timezone: Africa/Johannesburg
    API->>Filter: Normalize to UTC (‚Üí 08:00 UTC)
    Filter->>API: Pass normalized UTC
    API->>Database: Save 08:00 UTC
    Database-->>API: Return 08:00 UTC
    API-->>Browser: Send 08:00 UTC
    Note right of Browser: JavaScript converts 08:00 UTC ‚Üí 10:00 local
    Browser->>User: Displays 10:00 (correct!)

```

## ‚úÖ What It Does

- Accepts a time zone via `X-Timezone` (e.g. `Africa/Johannesburg`)
- Converts date/time inputs from the user's local time to UTC accurately for consistent storage
- Supports:
  - `DateTime`
  - `DateOnly`
  - Nullable versions of both
- Works globally via an action filter

## Why Date Normalization Solves the Bug

When a user sends a date or datetime from the frontend (e.g., Angular), the value is usually a **local time without explicit timezone context**. By default, .NET or the server may **interpret this incoming date as UTC**, which causes an incorrect shift in the stored value.

For example, a user in UTC+2 sending `2025-07-02T10:00:00` may have their time saved as `2025-07-02T10:00:00Z` (UTC), which is actually 2 hours earlier than intended, resulting in incorrect times on retrieval.

### What Normalization Does

Our API filter:

- **Reads the incoming datetime as if it is in the user‚Äôs local timezone** (using the `X-Timezone` header)
- **Converts that local time to UTC** correclty with no mismatch before storing or processing
- This preserves the exact moment in time the user intended, avoiding unintended timezone shifts

### Converting Dates Back to Local Time on the Client

The backend stores and returns dates in **standard UTC ISO 8601 format** (e.g., `2025-07-02T08:00:00Z`). To display dates correctly:

- The frontend (Angular) parses these UTC dates using JavaScript‚Äôs `Date` object.
- It converts the UTC date to the user‚Äôs local timezone automatically.
- Example in Angular/JavaScript:

```typescript
const utcDate = new Date("2025-07-02T08:00:00Z");
const localDateString = utcDate.toLocaleString(); // Displays in user's local timezone
```

## ‚úÖ Date Normalization Test Cases

### ‚ùå Without Filter (Bug)

**Request:**

```
{
  "eventTime": "2025-07-02T10:00:00",
  "eventDate": "2025-07-02"
}
```
- Expected Timezone: Africa/Johannesburg (UTC+2)

**Response:**
```
{
  "serverReceived": {
    "eventTime": "2025-07-02T10:00:00",
    "eventDate": "2025-07-02"
  },
  "serverNow": "2025-07-02T21:31:02.3675393+00:00",
  "serverUtcNow": "2025-07-02T21:31:02.3675417Z"
}
```
**Problem:** 
The server stores and returns the time exactly as sent (10:00), but interprets it as UTC instead of the user's local time. This causes a 2-hour shift in meaning ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually treated as 12:00 in Johannesburg, not the intended 10:00.

### ‚úÖ With Filter (Correct Behavior)
**Same Request:**
```
{
  "eventTime": "2025-07-02T10:00:00",
  "eventDate": "2025-07-02"
}

//Note
Header: X-Timezone: Africa/Johannesburg
```

**Response:**
```
{
  "serverReceived": {
    "eventTime": "2025-07-02T08:00:00Z",
    "eventDate": "2025-07-02"
  },
  "serverNow": "2025-07-02T21:28:22.4007827+00:00",
  "serverUtcNow": "2025-07-02T21:28:22.4007835Z"
}
```

**Explanation:**
The filter interprets the 10:00 input as being in Africa/Johannesburg, and converts it to UTC 08:00 for storage. This preserves the exact intended moment across timezones. When sent back to the user, the frontend can safely convert it back to 10:00 local time.

## üöÄ Run and Test Locally with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t local-dotnet-utc
```
2. Run the container on port 5000:
```
docker run -p 5000:5000 local-dotnet-utc
```

3. Open in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5000/
```

4. To test APIs needing the X-Timezone header, use Postman or another API tool.

5. To stop the container, press Ctrl + C or run:
```
docker ps
docker stop <container_id>
```

## üí° Why It Matters

ASP.NET APIs often treat dates as UTC unless told otherwise. This project ensures dates are saved and returned as the user expects ‚Äî based on their actual time zone.
